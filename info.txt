## üåê **2. Multiplayer Architecture**

### **Real-Time Networking Solution**

WebSockets provide a bi-directional communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. This means data can flow in both directions (from client to server and vice versa) simultaneously. This isn't natively possible with traditional HTTP. WebSockets are bidirectional, meaning both the client and server can send information at any time. Players can send data (actions) to the server, and the server can instantly broadcast game updates to all players.

### **Recommended Architecture:**

```
Client (Unity) ‚Üê‚Üí WebSocket Server (Node.js + Socket.io) ‚Üê‚Üí Redis ‚Üê‚Üí MongoDB
                        ‚Üï
                   Game Room Manager
                        ‚Üï
                 Islamic Content API
```

### **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Backend Stack:**
- **WebSocket Server:** Node.js + Socket.io
- **Real-time State:** Redis (for game rooms, active matches)
- **Persistent Data:** MongoDB (user profiles, game history, questions)
- **Content API:** Express.js REST API for Islamic content

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Game Rooms:** 2-4 players per room
2. **Real-time Synchronization:** Card draws, answers, scores
3. **Spectator Mode:** Watch friends play
4. **Tournament System:** Competitive Islamic knowledge contests
5. **Leaderboards:** Global and local rankings
